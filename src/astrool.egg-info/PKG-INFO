Description: .. astrool
        
        astrool is an open source pure Python package dedicated to problems arising in life of
        day to day Astronomy, such as orbit propagation, night sky plotting,
        analemma plotting, conversion between position and velocity vectors and classical
        orbital elements and orbit plotting.
        It is released under the MIT license.
        
        Requirements
        ============
        
        astrool requires the following Python packages:
        
        * NumPy, for basic numerical routines
        * Astropy, for physical units and time handling
        * ephem, for the planetary ephemerides using SPICE kernels
        * matplotlib
        * poliastro

        FAQ
        ===
        
        What's up with the name?
        ------------------------
        
        astrool is made up of astro + tools. So basically, we are trying to come up with an aggregated software.
        
        
        What's the future of the project?
        ---------------------------------
        
        astrool is a very new project and we aim to develop it further so that it can become one
        package for all in basic astronomy.
